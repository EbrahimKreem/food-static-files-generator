1. we need to add basic tests for methods from objects.js files.
   it will cause an errors, because it looks like we break some code inside of it.
   by opening a PR we'll be forced to fix it and make tests for it works as well

2. at debug folder we have a simple version of how to test that our current methods working after running a build script. I think cases like this and also more advanced should be just covered by using Jest help.
